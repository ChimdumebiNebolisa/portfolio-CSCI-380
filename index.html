      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an international student from Nigeria studying Computer Science at East Texas A&amp;M University, with an expected
        graduation in May 2027. Alongside my academics, I serve as a Resident Assistant, where I manage health and safety inspections,
        support 30+ residents, and organize community events.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have hands-on experience in full-stack development using technologies like React, Node.js, Flask, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. My work includes building responsive front-end interfaces and deploying secure, scalable back-end systems. I am also
        certified in Responsive Web Design through FreeCodeCamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coursework and projects, I’ve worked as a Web Developer at FashionFlow Styles in Nigeria, officiated intramural sports,
        and remain active in the African Students Association. My goal is to apply technology to solve real-world problems and contribute
        to closing the digital divide.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a computer science student at Boise State University who is passionate about using technology to create accessible, human-centered solutions. I enjoy working at the intersection of product design, data, and engineering to craft experiences that solve real problems and empower the people who use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey has included leading research and product initiatives focused on accessibility, mentoring students who are curious about technology, and collaborating across disciplines to ship thoughtful solutions. I thrive in environments where I can combine creativity with analytical thinking, and I am always eager to learn new tools that help teams deliver meaningful products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the classroom and workplace, I dedicate time to community-building efforts that champion diversity in tech. Whether I am facilitating workshops, organizing events, or contributing to open-source projects, I aim to uplift others and make technology more inclusive.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a computer science student at Boise State University who is passionate about using technology to create accessible, human-centered solutions. I enjoy working at the intersection of product design, data, and engineering to craft experiences that solve real problems and empower the people who use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey has included leading research and product initiatives focused on accessibility, mentoring students who are curious about technology, and collaborating across disciplines to ship thoughtful solutions. I thrive in environments where I can combine creativity with analytical thinking, and I am always eager to learn new tools that help teams deliver meaningful products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the classroom and workplace, I dedicate time to community-building efforts that champion diversity in tech. Whether I am facilitating workshops, organizing events, or contributing to open-source projects, I aim to uplift others and make technology more inclusive.

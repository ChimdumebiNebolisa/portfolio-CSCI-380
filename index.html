        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am an international student from Nigeria studying Computer Science at East Texas A&amp;M University, with an expected
          graduation in May 2027. Alongside my academics, I serve as a Resident Assistant, where I manage health and safety inspections,
          support 30+ residents, and organize community events.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience in full-stack development using technologies like React, Node.js, Flask, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. My work includes building responsive front-end interfaces and deploying secure, scalable back-end systems. I am also
          certified in Responsive Web Design through FreeCodeCamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coursework and projects, Iâ€™ve worked as a Web Developer at FashionFlow Styles in Nigeria, officiated intramural sports,
          and remain active in the African Students Association. My goal is to apply technology to solve real-world problems and
          contribute to closing the digital divide.
